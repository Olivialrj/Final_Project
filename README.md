# The project's name: Final_Project

## A description of the project :

This project is a front-end web application developed as part of my final project for TripleTen. The application fetches news from a News API based on user search queries. It features an intuitive interface that allows users to save their favorite news articles and categorize them using the keywords they searched with.

## and its functionality:

### User interface:

A clean and modern layout with a responsive design for seamless use on various devices.
A header that displays the search bar and navigation.

### News Mangement:

Users can save their favorite news articles by clicking the save icon on the news article modal. Each saved article will be categorized based on the search keywords used.
A preloader is displayed when users enter a search query, indicating that the app is fetching results. This is controlled by the isLoading state, which is set to true during the data retrieval process and false once the results are loaded.

### Modal Interactions:

Modal windows are used for registration and logins, with functionality to open and close the modal.
Users can close the modal by clicking outside of it or pressing the Escape key.

### News Integration:

The app retrieves and displays news article based on the search query that is provided by the user.
The application fetches news from a News API, but it only retrieves articles from the past week to ensure relevance and timeliness.

### Event Handling:

TThe application uses event listeners to handle clicks and key presses effectively, ensuring that users can easily interact with the modal and navigate through the app.

## A description of the technologies and techniques used:

### React.js

Overview: A popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces, React.js allows for the creation of reusable UI components, which leads to a more organized and maintainable codebase. Benefits: Reactâ€™s component-based architecture enables the development of dynamic and interactive web applications, improving user experience by updating only parts of the interface that change.

### JavaScript (ES6+)

Overview: The core programming language used to build the app, leveraging modern features like arrow functions, destructuring, and modules to enhance readability and maintainability. Techniques: Event Handling: Using event listeners to respond to user interactions, such as clicks and key presses. State Management: Utilizing the useState hook to manage component state and useEffect to handle side effects like data fetching and DOM manipulation.

### CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)

Overview: CSS is used for styling the application, ensuring a visually appealing and responsive design that enhances the user experience. Techniques: Flexbox/Grid Layout: Employing Flexbox or CSS Grid to create responsive layouts that adapt to various screen sizes. Modal Styling: Custom styles for modal components to improve their visibility and interactivity. Animations: Adding transitions and animations for modal appearance and disappearance, enhancing the user interface's smoothness.

### CSS Modules or Styled Components (if applicable)

Overview: A technique for writing CSS that scopes styles to individual components, preventing style conflicts and enhancing modularity. Benefits: This approach allows for better organization of styles and easier maintenance as the application grows.

### Weather API Integration

Overview: The app integrates with a weather API to fetch real-time weather data, providing users with relevant clothing recommendations based on current weather conditions. Techniques: Asynchronous Fetching: Using fetch or axios for making asynchronous API requests to retrieve weather data, which is then processed and displayed in the app. Data Filtering: Implementing functions to filter weather data and match it with the appropriate clothing items.

### React Hooks

Overview: Utilizing React hooks, particularly useEffect and useState, for managing component lifecycle and state effectively. Techniques: Data Fetching: Using useEffect to fetch weather data when the component mounts or when dependencies change. Dynamic State Management: Employing useState to manage the state of modals, user inputs, and clothing options.

### Event Listeners and Handlers

Overview: Implementing custom event handlers to manage user interactions, ensuring responsive and intuitive navigation. Techniques: Close Modal on Outside Click: Handling click events to close modals when the user clicks outside of the modal content. Keyboard Navigation: Listening for the Escape key to allow users to close modals using the keyboard.

### Responsive Design

Overview: Designing the application to ensure compatibility across various devices and screen sizes. Techniques: Media Queries: Utilizing CSS media queries to adapt styles for different viewport sizes. Fluid Layouts: Creating flexible layouts that adjust based on the available screen space.

# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
